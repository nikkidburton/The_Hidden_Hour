# The_Hidden_Hour
Yolin is a highschool student who starts getting threatening text messages from a stranger she doesn't know. When she finds herself in the hospital all the clocks are premeantly stopped at 1/2 passed midnight and if Yolin want to get out of this nightmare she make her way out of the hospital with Hugo a weirdly smart cockatoo.
